# Obtaining data

In this tutorial we use 4 datasets from the Sacurine study

> ### {% icon tip %} Background: The Sacurine dataset
> Summary:
> - **Objective**: inï¬‚uence of age, body mass index, and gender on the urine metabolome
> - **Cohort**: 183 employees from CEA
> - **LC-HRMS**: LTQ-Orbitrap (negative ionization mode)
{: .tip}

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Obtaining our data
>
> The Toy Dataset is available in Zenodo: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.1346742.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1346742)

> Download all of them

# Import the "Raw" data in "DataSet Collection"

> ### {% icon tip %} Tip: Format
> The format (and datatype) allowed
> * mzxml
> * mzml
> * mzdata
> * netcdf
{: .tip}
>
> ### {% icon warning %} Warning: Be careful about ...
> We will assume that each individual file is **less than 2Go**.
>
> Otherwise, you will have the use the FTP method which will be describe **soon** in an other tutorial.

>
> 1. Click on the **Upload button** at top-right of the tool panel.
> > ![Click on the Upload button](../../images/tutorial-lcms-data-import-raw-01.png)
>
> 2. Click on the **Collection** tab in the upload window.
> > ![Click on the Upload button](../../images/tutorial-lcms-data-import-raw-02.png)
>
> 3. Drag and Drop your "raw data" .mzXML within the upload window.
> > /!\ You should get displayed in yellow "Drop files here"
> > ![Click on the Upload button](../../images/tutorial-lcms-data-import-raw-03.png)
>
>    > ### {% icon warning %} Warning: Be careful about ...
>    > Do not include your SampleMetadata file, just raw files
>    {: .warning-box}
>
> 4. [optional] Select the datatype in the **File Type** drop list
>
>    > ### {% icon tip %} Tip: A tip
>    > To save time during the upload phase, please select the correct "File Type".
>    > That way Galaxy will not have to guess the type for each file
>    {: .tip}
> > ![Click on the Upload button](../../images/tutorial-lcms-data-import-raw-04.png)
>
> 5. **Start** the upload itself
> > ![Click on the Upload button](../../images/tutorial-lcms-data-import-raw-05.png)
>
> 6. Please **wait**
> > You can observe the Status bar and the dataset which are arriving in the history panel in background.
> >
> > This step can take hours depending of your Internet connection and the load of the W4M server.
> > ![Click on the Upload button](../../images/tutorial-lcms-data-import-raw-06.png)
>
> 7. As soon as the **Build** button is available, click on it
> > ![Click on the Upload button](../../images/tutorial-lcms-data-import-raw-07.png)
>
> 8. Name your future Dataset Collection
> > ![Click on the Upload button](../../images/tutorial-lcms-data-import-raw-08.png)
>
> 9. Done
> > As you can see the original dataset have been hidden to make room for the Dataset Collection with its 4 individuals datasets.
> >
> > The aim of the Dataset Collections is to use them as a sort of Dataset to not have to feed the tools with numerous individual datasets.
> > ![Click on the Upload button](../../images/tutorial-lcms-data-import-raw-09.png)
> > If you click on the Dataset Collection name, the nested datasets are shown.

> ### {% icon tip %} Tip: A tip
>
> If you miss the build step, don't panic.
>
> Because for example, the upload phase was too long.

>    > ### {% icon solution %} Solution
>    >
>    > You can still build a Dataset Collection:
>    > 1. From your history panel
>    > 2. Click on the Tick button above your Datasets
>    > 3. Choose in the list **Build Dataset List**
>    > 4. Name your future Dataset Collection
>    > 5. Done!
